## About this notebook

This notebook contains code and explanatory text that your should review and run as you read through chapters 1 - 5 of the course textbook, "Data Journalism with R and the Tidyverse". Answer questions and edit the document as directed.

Running this notebook will help you understand key data analysis methods and concepts that you will put into practice during this week's lab. When you come across a new command or verb in R, you should add it to your class reference notebook file along with what it's used for.

When you are finished running the code in this notebook, you will push changes to your course GitHub repo, and upload the link to ELMS as instructed.

You also should update your class reference notebook with code examples and what they mean. When you come across a new concept or R verb, put it in your reference notebook along with a sentence about what it does. For example:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

The library function loads an R library such as the tidyverse, providing access to the verbs and functions that library contains. You have to load a library before you can use its functions.

### Task 1: The console

**Task** In the console (look below), type 2+2 and hit enter. What does it return? Type your answer below. **Answer:**

2+2

###This exercise's output is the answer 4. 

### Task 2: Variables

**Task** Put the following code -- which stores the numeral 2 as a variable called number -- in the console and hit enter.

```{r}
number <- 2
```

Then type this code to multiply the variable called number by itself.

```{r}
number * number
```

What does it return? Type your answer below: **Answer:**

### This exercise also returns the answer 4, but does it using a word that's given a meaning in R. 


### Task 3: Install packages

**Task** In the console, run the following code to install the Tidyverse:

```{r}
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

**Task** Add that

Then run the following code to install the rmarkdown library

```{r}
install.packages('rmarkdown')
```

## Chapter 6

### Task 1: Load libraries

**Task** Run the following code in the gray-colored codeblock below -- not in the console -- to load the tidyverse library. To run the code, click the little green play button (left facing arrow) at the top right of the codeblock. In Rmarkdown data notebooks, we write code inside of codeblocks, and explanatory text in the white area outside of it.

```{r}
# This is a comment inside of a codeblock. Comments doesn't run when we run the codeblock.
# Adding this command is a good way to start your class reference notebook.
library(tidyverse)
```

### Task 2: Load data

**Task** Load the Maryland WinRed contributions dataset by running the following codeblock.

```{r}
maryland_winred_contributions <- read_rds("pre_lab_01.rds")
```

Once it loads, look at the environment window at right in RStudio for maryland_winred_contributions. It's next to a small blue circle with a white arrow in it. To the right of that, look at how many "obs" the dataset has ("obs" is short for observation, which is another way of saying rows or records). Look at how many variables it has (another way of saying columns or fields). Write the number of observations and variables below.

**Answer**

###This has 24 variables and 131,395 observations.

### Task 3: Glimpse data

**Task** Run the following codeblock to use glimpse() to get a sense of the data, some of the values in each field/variable/column, and the data types of each field/variable/column.

```{r}
glimpse(maryland_winred_contributions)
```

In the space below, write the data type for the "last_name" column and the "amount" columns (it's in light gray, offset by \< \>). Also offer your best guess as to what the "last_name" column and the "amount" column represent. **Answer**

### The last_name column has <chr> and the amount column has the <dbl>. I would guess that <chr> is for names and places like things that don't involve math. Dbl is maybe for numbers and things that can me involved with math. 

### Task 4: Examine data "head"

**Task** Run the following codeblock to use head() to examine the first six rows of data. Explore the data by clicking the black arrow on the right side of the output table, allowing you to examine additional columns.

```{r}
head(maryland_winred_contributions)
```

In the space below, write the first and last name from the _second_ row of the data. **Answer**

## Peggy Mukai. 

### Task 5: Explore data with interactive dataframe

**Task** look at the environment window at right in RStudio for maryland_winred_contributions It's next to a small blue circle with a white arrow in it. Click on the maryland_winred_contributions -- not the blue circle. It will open the dataframe as an interactive table. Scroll down to see additional rows. Scroll left to see additional columns. Click on a column name to sort by that column.

##I focused on occupation.

### Task 6: Group and count

**Task** Run the following codeblock:

```{r}
maryland_winred_contributions |>
  group_by(date) |>
  summarise(
    count_contribs = n()
  )
```

Describe what you think this code is doing below. What does the answer represent, compared to the results from `head()`?

**Answer**

###The code here organized the column name by the amount of each answer presented in the data set. Head is just shows the first few rows and columns and their answers, so you could have a general understanding of what is inside the maryland_winred_contributions.

### Task 7: Adding arrange()

**Task** Run the following codeblock:

```{r}
maryland_winred_contributions |>
  group_by(date) |>
  summarise(
    count_contribs = n()
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(count_contribs))
```

Compared to the previous codeblock, what has changed and how did that affect the result?

**Answer**

###The difference is that now the data presented from largest to smallest. This make it easier to know and organize how many people did it on a specific date and now you can start asking why on that date. 

### Task 8: Multiple grouping

**Task** Run the following codeblock.

```{r}
maryland_winred_contributions |>
  group_by(memo_text, amount) |>
  summarise(
    count_contribs = n()
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(count_contribs))
```

Compared to the previous codeblock, what has changed and how did that affect the result?

**Answer**

###The difference is that there are now two columns that are analyzed: memo_text and amount. This codeblock is more specific compared to the other one since it tells us what organizations, the amount of money and how many people have done the same amount of donations. This makes it to know what story angle to look for.

### Task 9

**Task** Run the following codeblock:

```{r}
maryland_winred_contributions |>
  group_by(memo_text) |>
  summarise(
    count_contribs = n(),
    total_amount = sum(amount)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(total_amount))
```

Compared to the previous codeblock, what has changed and how did that affect the result? 

**Answer**

###This codeblock grouped the organizations with the number of people that contributed money and used addition to give us the total amount that the organization raised. The other codeblock tells us how many people donated, for example, $5 for TRUMP SAVE AMERICA JOINT FUNDRAISING COMMITTEE and $3 for that same one. This one adds all the values together and gives us the total money that was raised. Now we can report in a story how much was raised in total for each organization and how many donated.  Also, the data is arranged from largest to smallest by total amount donated instead of the number of contributors.  
 

### Task 10: More descriptive statistics

**Task** Run the following codeblock to group the maryland_winred_contributions dataframe by the recipient for each contribution. Then do the following summarizations for each group:count the number of contributions, add up the value of all contributions, and calculate the mean and median contribution amounts. Then sort so the recipient with the most contributions is listed first.

```{r}
maryland_winred_contributions |>
  group_by(memo_text) |>
  summarise(
    count_contribs = n(),
    total_amount = sum(amount),
    mean_amount = mean(amount),
    median_amount = median(amount)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(count_contribs))
```

Compared to the previous codeblock, what has changed and how did that affect the result? Glancing at the names, which of the top results from Maryland?

**Answer**

### The difference is that we can know that of the total contributed what was the average and median amount of money that the people donated. Also, the data is arranged by largest to least by the total amount that was donated rather than the amount of contributors each organization had. Te results could change if you arrange using total amount. 

###The name with the top results is the Trump National Committee JFC,INC. 


### Task 11

**Task** Run the following codeblock to group the maryland_winred_contributions dataframe by the city for each contribution. Then do the following summarizations for each group:count the number of contributions, add up the value of all contributions, calculate the mean and median contributions amounts and calculate the smallest and largest contributions Then sort so the city with the largest total contribution amount is listed first.

```{r}
maryland_winred_contributions |>
  group_by(city) |>
  summarise(
    count_contribs = n(),
    total_amount = sum(amount),
    mean_amount = mean(amount),
    median_amount = median(amount),
    min_amount = min(amount),
    max_amount = max(amount)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(total_amount))
```

Compared to the previous codeblock, what has changed and how did that affect the result? How is the data sorted? **Answer**

### The changes is that it's being grouped by Maryland cities and arranged by the total amount donated by city. The code added the minimum donated and maximum donated in the output. Because its grouped by city we can know which cities has given the largest amount of money in Maryland and divide that information by average, median, minimum and maximum. This gives a bigger picture of  dontations in Md. One thing that can change the order of this output is if its arranged by people contributed. Annapolis is on the top of the list by the total amount, but Hagerstown has more doners. Who or what is on the top list depends on how its arranged.
