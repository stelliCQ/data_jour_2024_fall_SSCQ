### In the article, Jack Bergman of Michigan was the top spender. We filtered to see if we can match the amount that was said to be reimbursed in food and lodgings. However, lodgings was
# 29,066.44 and not 32,000. Are big issue is that for meals its $12,000 in the article.
#Our current code is missing most of that money. 
#Should we use OPEN REFINE?

##From filtering this we can confirm that Matt Gaetz spent $32,751 for Lodging, if we add travel totals to lodgings.
## However for meals we got $4,726 by adding the things below, and not the 12,000 in the WaPo article.

Concluding Note: 

###In this first part of the assignment, we tried to figure copy the results of paragraph one
that was about Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Mich.) being the program's top spender, and that he was 
reimbursed more than $32,000 for lodging and nearly $12,000 for meals in 2023.

##We were close in lodgings for Bergman, but not for meals.

### We also tried to reverse engineer that Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) was the programâ€™s second-highest overall spender with over $30,000 in lodging expenses and more than $11,000 for meals in 2023.

##We were able to confirm the over 30,000 expense on lodgings but not for meals. 

***PART 2: THIS IS WHAT WE DID FOR OCTOBER 13, 2024***

**P3.  Some members of Congress who own homes in the Washington area, including Reps. Patrick T. McHenry (R-N.C.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), have chosen not to participate in the program at all. Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), who owns a $1 million home in Virginia, was reimbursed less than $1,500 each month.**

We were able to confirm that Jim Banks of Indiana was reimbursed less than $1,500 each month for lodgings. What 
we did was first fix the dates that were though to be characters. Then we filtered by
Jim Banks, then the transaction year we want and the month we want to examine. 

We then grouped by description and then did total amount to see. We ended up
getting $3862.99, which didn't make sense. So then we filtered by "LODGING".
In LODGING we were able to see that the perform start date and end date were
the month this transaction occured. This data gave me the months of January,
February and March. We got back for these months for lodgings: 1158, 1354, and 
1350. This confirms that he was reimbursed less than 1,500 each month.


```{r}
JIM <- us_rep_expense |>
