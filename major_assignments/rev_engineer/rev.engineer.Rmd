# We understand that to show all representatives and senators we need to filter. We want to know

#What could be a possibility to take out the committees and offices unrelated to specific congressmen quickly?

### In the article, Jack Bergman of Michigan was the top spender. We filtered to see if we can match the amount that was said to be reimbursed in food and lodgings. However, lodgings was
# 29,066.44 and not 32,000. Are big issue is that for meals its $12,000 in the article.
#Our current code is missing most of that money. 
#Should we use OPEN REFINE?

#We added both the 2023 and 2024 organization for Jack Bergman to see if we are closer.

##From filtering this we can confirm that Matt Gaetz spent $32,751 for Lodging, if we add travel totals to lodgings.
## However for meals we got $4,726 by adding the things below, and not the 12,000 in the WaPo article.

Concluding Note: 

###In this first part of the assignment, we tried to figure copy the results of paragraph one
that was about Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Mich.) being the program's top spender, and that he was 
reimbursed more than $32,000 for lodging and nearly $12,000 for meals in 2023.

##We were close in lodgings for Bergman, but not for meals.

### We also tried to reverse engineer that Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) was the programâ€™s second-highest overall 
spender with over $30,000 in lodging expenses and more than $11,000 for meals in 2023.

##We were able to confirm the over 30,000 expense on lodgings but not for meals.
